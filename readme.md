# GitHub Action Rsync

Push code changes to a remote server over SSH. See [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml) for an example of using the script in a GitHub action.

The `rsync` command is in a PowerShell script [scripts/sync.ps1](scripts/sync.ps1), so you may also use the command interactively during development.

## Todo

- Create an `action.yml` file for use across other repositories.
